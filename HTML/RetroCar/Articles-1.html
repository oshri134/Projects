            <p class="lead">
                <p>When it comes to getting a car repaired, what we really need is a reliable rating scheme for garages
                    Finding a decent garage to look after your car is a bit like finding a reliable builder – it’s definitely harder than it should be. It’s a task that you'd think would be made easier by ratings schemes, but it can actually be made more difficult due to the sheer number of schemes aiming to provide impartial advice.</p>
                    
                    <p>First of all, it’s worth investigating what a “rating” actually signifies. It should mean undercover inspectors turning up out of the blue, as they might to give a hotel its coveted stars. At the very least they should probe technicians’ qualifications and how up-to-date their equipment and mechanical know-how is.</p>
                    
                  <p>  In the more rigorous schemes, this happens. Others are simply listings dressed up to look like ratings services. I found one scheme that’s run by a lubricants company and whose featured garages only make the list because they buy the product. That information was revealed by a rival ratings scheme.</p>
                    
                   <p> How do you know whether any garages on these sites are any good? The answer is you don’t. The Retail Motor Industry Federation’s Trust My Garage scheme comes close. It checks that its member garages, which number more than 2,000, work to specific standards. Plus it has a customer charter for its members.</p>
                    
                <p>  The Motor Codes rating scheme, along with Bosch Car Service garages, must comply with guidelines laid down by the Government’s Trading Standards Institute. The 7,800 garages on Motor Codes’ books, including 2,200 independents, are checked every other year by the AA. “People are watching us,” said a Motor Codes spokesman. “We have to report the performance of our garages to Trading Standards.” Doing that means that you have greater protection should something go awry if you use a Motor Codes or Bosch-rated garage.</p>  
                    
                 <p>   The Motor Codes website provided a listing of 73 garages in my area. Only 12 had ratings from customers and one had been expelled. But a spokesman said: “A year ago, we were getting 2,000 customer reviews a month. Now it is about 10,000, so it’s really building momentum.”</p>
                    
                  <p>This prompts several questions. Why is this happening only now so that a worthwhile initiative like that of Motor Codes is playing catch-up? More importantly, why shouldn’t all garages obey some simple standards? There could be multiple breakdown companies helping ensure they’re up to scratch.</p>  
                    
                   <p>If they’re not, they should be struck off, as might a doctor or dentist. It should have been done years ago.</p>
